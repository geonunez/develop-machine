# Vagrant Docker Machine

As MacOSX user with a old laptop, I couldn't run correctly docker with docker-machine solutions (Write permission a big problem for me).

For that reason I create a debian machine with docker to run it completly inside a VBox. 

### Note
I use the folder '/vagrant' in the host machine as a symlink to my project folders.
